<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

<br>
The Avengers Infinity War Marvel Mancala project came into creation during my time at the General Assembly - 9/26/22 Software Engineering Bootcamp.  For our first project, the instructors tasked us with creating a browser based game from certain choices.  The requirements were below.  

Requirements:
* Use everything we learned in the first unit of Front End development
* Build the HTML, CSS, and Javascript files from scratch
* Have fun and learn!

When I saw that the instructors offered a choice of Mancala, I chose it.  Mancala was one of my favorite games growing up.  I also love the MCU, and immediately thought of Avengers Infinity War because mancala uses similar "stones" and either side needs to collect more than the other... hence Avengers Infinity War Marvel Mancala!
